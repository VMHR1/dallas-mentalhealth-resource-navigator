# Cloudflare Pages redirects and rewrites
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/

# SPA fallback - redirect all non-file requests to index.html
# This ensures client-side routing works
/*    /index.html   200

# Example: Redirect old URLs (if you have any)
# /old-path    /new-path    301

# Example: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Cloudflare does this automatically, but you can be explicit)
# http://example.com/*    https://example.com/:splat    301
