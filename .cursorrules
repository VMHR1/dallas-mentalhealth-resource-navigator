## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Mental health program management system focused on program validation, location-based matching, and specialized search functionality.

## Core Domain Components

### Program Validation Framework
- Domain-specific validation for mental health services
- Service area validation with multi-region support
- Age range verification with special "and up" handling
- Insurance coverage validation
- 90-day reverification requirements
- Multiple verification source tracking

### Service Area Management
- Geographic service area definitions (point, counties, statewide)
- Virtual/telehealth service handling
- Multi-region coverage support
- County-based service area mapping

### Program Search & Matching
- Mental health terminology parsing
- Care level classification (PHP, IOP, Outpatient, Navigation, Crisis)
- Location-aware program matching
- Service domain categorization (mental health, substance use, co-occurring)
- Program relationship mapping based on care levels

## Business Rules

### Service Delivery Models
- Virtual service delivery requirements
- Hybrid program handling
- In-person location requirements
- Service area overlap calculations

### Program Classification
- Level of care categorization
- Service domain mapping
- Age range requirements
- Insurance acceptance rules
- Crisis resource handling

### Verification Requirements
- 90-day program reverification cycle
- Source documentation tracking
- Location precision levels
- Service area validation rules
