Core data models govern the structure and validation of mental health program records:

## Program Schema
- Required fields:
  - program_id: Unique identifier 
  - organization: Operating entity
  - program_name: Public display name
  - level_of_care: PHP/IOP/Outpatient/Navigation/Crisis
  - service_domains: Mental health/substance use/co-occurring
  - age_ranges: Supported age groups with "and up" handling
  - service_areas: Geographic coverage regions

## Service Area Models
- Point location (single facility)
- County coverage (multiple jurisdictions)
- Statewide provider designation
- Multi-region service areas
- Virtual/telehealth delivery flags

## Validation Rules
- Age range consistency checks
- Service area overlap detection
- Required fields based on delivery model:
  - Physical location for in-person services
  - Contact methods for virtual offerings
  - Hybrid service documentation requirements

## Verification Tracking
- 90-day reverification requirement
- Multiple verification source types:
  - Website URLs
  - Phone verification records
  - Email confirmation tracking
- Location precision levels:
  - Rooftop accuracy
  - Street level
  - ZIP code
  - City approximation

## Service Domain Mappings
- Care level hierarchies
- Service type categorization
- Age group overlap handling
- Geographic coverage resolution

The data models ensure consistent representation of mental health programs while enforcing domain-specific business rules around verification, service areas, and program accessibility.
