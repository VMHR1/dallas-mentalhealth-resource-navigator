# algorithm-program-matching

Program matching logic score: 85/100

## Core Matching Components

### Location-Based Program Matching (/js/modules/distance.js)
- Geographic service area calculations with multi-region support
- Virtual/telehealth service delivery detection
- Distance calculations incorporating service boundaries
- Special handling for statewide and multi-region providers

### Mental Health Search Algorithm (/js/modules/search.js)
- Domain-specific search for mental health programs
- Smart parsing of mental health terminology and care levels
- Program name and services fuzzy matching
- Multi-city location awareness

### Program Matching Rules
1. Service Area Logic:
- Programs can serve multiple counties
- Statewide provider special handling
- Virtual delivery considerations
- Multi-region coverage support

2. Filtering Criteria:
- Care level matching (PHP, IOP, Outpatient, Navigation, Crisis)
- Service domain alignment (mental health, substance use, co-occurring)
- Age range compatibility with "and up" edge cases
- Geographic service area validation

3. Crisis Resource Prioritization:
- Emergency resource identification
- Crisis program elevation in results
- Immediate access service flagging
- Geographic proximity weighting for crisis services

## Search Implementation Details

### Program Detail Processing
- Care level based related program discovery
- Virtual/hybrid delivery model detection
- Insurance coverage validation
- Accessibility requirement matching

### Validation Requirements
- 90-day program reverification
- Multiple verification source support
- Location precision levels
- Service area boundary verification
